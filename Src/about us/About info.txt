Ramachaane Academy is a private English medium primary school that began in 1997, and grDUted its first Grade 7 classin 2010. Rmachaane currently has nearly 400 students, PR through Grade 7. Each class is small (no more than 26 students), allowing the teachers to give as much attention as possible to each child. We have 2 classes in every grade in order to keep up with the demand, with a waiting list in almost every class. The Grade 4-7 students are taught by several different teacher that specialize in specific subjects, allowing them to benefit from each teacher's expertise.


Ramachaane has high academic standards. Most of the children begin at Ramachaane in Grade R or PR, and continue all the way through Grade 7. Those who come in later must pass English and Maths entrance tests in order to keep our standards high.



In addition to our academic standards we strive to teach our children to love and serve  Christ, as well as the values of discipline, kindness, servanthood and hard work. Outreaches into the community help Ramachaane students live out our motto and the meaning of our name -"Let's Help Each Other"
